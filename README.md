# GregTech 6 Community Edition

**English** | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

A community integration project bringing GregTech 6 to modern Minecraft, with a shared core and dedicated Forge and NeoForge implementations.

## About

GregTech 6 Community Edition combines work from **saltnya's gregtech6reborn**, **brokestar233's gregtech6**, and **lombinaxmasson's cruciblecraft**. The project uses saltnya's implementation as its initial content baseline while comparing and integrating the strengths of all three ports.

The goal is a coherent, maintainable mod with shared materials, recipes, machines, energy, and logistics, supported by the platform adaptations needed for each Minecraft version.

GregTech 6 centers on technology, resource processing, and industrial progression. This integration focuses on materials and alloys, tools, heat and crucibles, casting, steam, machines and generators, automation, multiblock machinery, and world generation.

## Minecraft Versions

- **Minecraft 1.20.1 — Forge**, targeting Forge **47.4.20**.
- **Minecraft 1.21.1 — NeoForge**, targeting NeoForge **21.1.243**.

Both platforms live in this repository and share the `core` module. Each produces a separate mod JAR with the shared core included. Install the artifact matching your Minecraft version and loader; no separate core JAR is required.

The mod name is **GregTech 6 Community Edition** and its loader ID is **`gregtech6`**. Existing content and resource identifiers retain the `gregtech:` namespace.

## Project Status

The project is under active integration. Version parity, the complete survival progression, client behavior, dedicated servers, and world persistence are still being validated. Compatibility with source-project worlds and across Minecraft versions has not been established.

Use separate instances for development builds and back up existing worlds. Progress and known gaps are recorded in the [integration status](docs/integration/STATUS.md) and [verification records](docs/integration/VERIFICATION.md).

## Building from Source

### Requirements

- **JDK 17** for the Gradle launcher, Forge, and the shared core.
- **JDK 21** for NeoForge.
- Internet access for the initial dependency download.

The repository includes **Gradle wrapper 8.8**. Run commands from the repository root. Set `JAVA17_HOME` and `JAVA21_HOME` to your JDK installation directories, and set `JAVA_HOME` to `JAVA17_HOME`.

Windows PowerShell example; replace the paths with your own installations:

```powershell
$env:JAVA17_HOME = 'C:\path\to\jdk-17'
$env:JAVA21_HOME = 'C:\path\to\jdk-21'
$env:JAVA_HOME = $env:JAVA17_HOME
```

### Build the Mod

Forge 1.20.1:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat --console=plain :distributionJar
```

NeoForge 1.21.1:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat --console=plain :neoforge:jar
```

Both versions:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat --console=plain :distributionJar :neoforge:jar
```

On Linux or macOS, set the same environment variables and use `./gradlew` instead of `.\gradlew.bat`. Run `chmod +x gradlew` if necessary.

Final artifacts are written to `build/libs/` for Forge and `neoforge/build/libs/` for NeoForge. Forge's `build/forge-intermediates/` directory contains intermediate output. The mod version is configured in `gradle.properties`.

See [BUILDING.md](docs/work/BUILDING.md) for complete setup, additional build options, and Git handoff instructions.

## Development Environment

Open the repository root as a Gradle project in IntelliJ IDEA or another IDE with Gradle support. Use the appropriate JDK for each module.

Forge development commands:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat :runClient
.\gradlew.bat :runServer
```

NeoForge development commands:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat :neoforge:runClient
.\gradlew.bat :neoforge:runServer
```

Run each command separately. Server setup requires acceptance of the Minecraft EULA. The existing Windows helper can also run shared-core checks and build both platforms:

```powershell
.\scripts\build.ps1 -Target all
```

## Support and Contributions

Use this repository's issue tracker for bug reports and feature suggestions. Include the Minecraft version, loader version, mod version, relevant logs, and clear reproduction steps in bug reports.

Contributions to code, documentation, translations, testing, and assets are welcome. Preserve original attribution and license notices, explain the source and purpose of changes, and document which platforms were checked. Shared gameplay rules belong in `core`; loader and Minecraft API adaptations belong in the platform modules.

Read the [collaboration guide](docs/integration/COLLABORATION.md), [integration plan](docs/integration/PLAN.md), and [source records](docs/integration/SOURCES.md) before preparing substantial changes.

## Addon development

Both platforms expose the shared `GregTechAddon` / `GregTechAddons` recipe lifecycle, material domain and energy contracts. Build the compile-only SDK with `:core:addonApiJar`; do not bundle its classes into an addon. See [the addon API guide](docs/ADDON_API.md) and [voltage tiers](docs/VOLTAGE_TIERS.md). API version 1 currently supports recipe-ready callbacks; new-material registration is not yet a supported automatic lifecycle.

## License

Project code is licensed under **LGPL-3.0-or-later**. The saltnya project owner confirmed this choice on 2026-10-02, aligning the integration with the brokestar233 and masson code declarations. See [LICENSE](LICENSE), [GPL 3.0 text](docs/licenses/GPL-3.0.txt), [NOTICE](NOTICE) and the [source license record](docs/integration/LICENSE_REVIEW.md).

Upstream GT6 default assets remain CC0-1.0 unless otherwise stated; GregTech logos and derivatives remain CC BY-NC 4.0. Other third-party notices and author attribution are retained. The code license does not relicense assets or third-party components. The old Forge MDK template is preserved in the source audit, separately from the current project declaration.
