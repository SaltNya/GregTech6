"""Generate the blockstates and models for GT6's tracks (`Loader_Rails:41-72`).

GT6's three rail families are registered by `registry/GTTrackBlocks.java`; this writes the client
side for them:

* one blockstate per track, following vanilla's `rail.json` / `powered_rail.json` /
  `detector_rail.json` shape (and `powered` on/off) variants,
* the per-material model stubs that re-texture vanilla's rail geometry with the GT6 iconset
  texture of that material (`assets/gregtech/textures/block/iconsets/rail_*.png`, already in the
  repo). Vanilla's rail models take the texture variable `rail`, so every stub is a one-liner.

Inputs : none (the table below mirrors `GTTrackBlocks.java` / GT6 `Loader_Rails:41-72`)
Output : src/main/resources/assets/gregtech/blockstates/track*.json
