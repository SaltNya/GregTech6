"""Generate the crafting recipes of GT6's ropes and explosives.

Source: the pattern arguments of GT6's registrations, read straight off
``Loader_MultiTileEntities:2086-2091`` (ropes) and ``:2235`` (boomstick); every row is
``CR.DEF_REV_NCC``, i.e. it wears the tools and does **not** mirror (``CR.java:161-163``).

  rope_silk   " S"  / "SS"  / "Sq"    S = string (GT6 Items.string),          q = scissors
  rope_grass  " GG" / "GGG" / "GGq"   G = dry grass (GT6 OD.itemGrassDry),    q = scissors
  rope_vine   " V"  / "VV"  / "Vb"    V = vine (GT6 Blocks.vine),             b = blade (GT6 swords)
  rope_steel  " P"  / "PP"  / "Px"    P = steel fine wire (GT6 OP.wireFine),  x = wire cutter
  boomstick   " S " / "PGP" / "DGD"   S = string, P = paper, G = gunpowder dust,
                                      D = SiO2 dust

Two of GT6's rope rows are deliberately *not* generated, with the original's own reason:
  * "rope" itself needs the ore-dictionary entry ``cropHemp``, which GT6 only fills from the HBM and
    Immersive Engineering compat loaders (``LoaderItemData:840-841``) - without those mods the
    original's own recipe is dead as well.
  * "rope_plastic" needs a fine wire of Plastic; the port's ``wireFine`` condition
    (``MaterialPrefix``: GENERATE_WIRE or PARTS+INGOT or the WIRES form flag) does not hold for
    Plastic, so the item does not exist yet (a material-form gap, not a recipe gap).

The dynamite itself comes from the Press, not from this file: GT6's rows for it are already
transpiled (``GTOtherGen``) and light up as soon as the block items exist.
