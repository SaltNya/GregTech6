"""Generate the port's wood-dictionary crafting rows from GT6's own wood table.

GT6 drives its wood recipes from two sources:

* ``gregapi/load/LoaderWoodDictionary.java`` (the task's ``gregapi/loaders/...``) builds the
  ``gregapi/wooddict`` table: ``new WoodEntry(log, new BeamEntry(beam, new PlankEntry(planks, slab,
  material, index), charcoal, creosote), charcoal, creosote)`` chains, with
  ``MT.WoodRubber``/``MT.WOODS.*`` as the plank material, plus the vanilla and other-mod entries.
* ``gregtech/loaders/c/Loader_Recipes_Woods.java`` (the task's ``gregtech/loaders/a/...``) iterates
  that table and registers the recipe rows: 128 statements in total, of which **71 are
  ``RM.<map>.addRecipe*(...)`` machine rows** (the "71 rows" of
  ``docs/PORTING_REMAINING_2026-09-14.md`` 搂2/搂14 - that count is the RM half; the other 57 are
  ``CR.shaped``/``CR.shapeless``/``CR.remove`` crafting rows).

This tool reads both files (plus the port's own wood sources) and writes
``src/main/java/com/gregtech/gregtech/content/recipe/GTWoodRecipes.java`` containing only the rows
the port can express, together with the unmappable rows and their GT6 line numbers.

 * ({@code gregtech/loaders/c/Loader_Recipes_Woods.java}, driven by
 * {@code gregapi/load/LoaderWoodDictionary.java} and {@code gregapi/wooddict/*}). GT6's file holds
 * @@row_count@@ recipe statements: <b>@@rm_count@@ {@code RM.*} machine rows</b> (the "71 rows" of
 * {@code docs/PORTING_REMAINING_2026-09-14.md} sections 2 and 14 count the {@code RM.*} statements) and
 * @@cr_count@@ {@code CR.shaped}/{@code CR.shapeless}/{@code CR.remove} crafting rows. The machine half is
 * already registered for the port's species by {@code content/recipe/RegisteredWoodSurvivalRecipes.java}
 * and {@code content/recipe/VanillaWoodProcessingRecipes.java}; the crafting half was missing and is
 * what this table carries.</p>
 *
 * <p>The rows iterate GT6's {@code WoodDictionary} entries. Only the entries backed by GT6's own nine
 * trees ({@code BlocksGT.LogA/LogB/LogC} metas 0-3/0-3/0) can be expressed: the port registers exactly
 * those species as {@code gregtech:log_*} / {@code gregtech:planks_*} / {@code gregtech:beam_*} blocks
 * ({@code registry/GTWoods.java}, {@code block/wood/WoodSpecies.java}). Every row below is registered
 * with the numbers GT6's own table carries for that species, with {@code CS.NERFED_WOOD = true}
 * ({@code gregapi/data/CS.java:866} in the original), i.e. the hand/saw counts rather than the
 * buzz-saw/lathe ones.</p>
 *
 * <p>Port differences, all of them deliberate:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>No fireproof wood: GT6's {@code BlocksGT.Log*FireProof}/{@code PlanksFireProof}/{@code Beam*FireProof}
 *       family (Laminator/Bath rows at {@code Loader_Recipes_Woods.java:46-119}) has no port block.</li>
 *   <li>No slabs or stairs for the port's species: GT6's {@code LIST_STAIRS}/{@code LIST_SLABS} rows
 *       ({@code :266-270}, {@code :288}, {@code :305}) are therefore skipped.</li>
 *   <li>Vanilla woods ({@code LoaderWoodDictionary.java:51-56}) keep vanilla's own recipes; the port's
 *       per-species log rows would only duplicate {@code minecraft:oak_planks} and friends.</li>
 *   <li>Other mods' wood (IC2/MFR/Atum/Fossil/BoP/TC/TF/BTL/Aether/Botania/Witchery/AbyssalCraft/
 *       Steamcraft/EBXL/Bamboo/Caveworld/TCFM/Forestry) is absent from 1.20.1.</li>
 *   <li>{@code MT.WOODS.Cinnamon} (GT6 material id 9317, "Cinnamonwood") is not registered by the port -
 *       it has only the Cinnamon <i>spice</i> (9785) - so the cinnamon entry contributes its four plank
 *       rows but not its four rod rows; those are listed in {@code SKIPPED_CRAFT_ROWS}, which together
 *       with {@code CRAFT_ROWS} accounts for the dictionary's {@code 9 x 8} rows.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>{@code CRAFT_ROWS} entries are {@code path|shape|mirror|pattern|keys|result|gt6}: pattern rows are
 * {@code /}-separated, keys are {@code symbol=spec} pairs separated by {@code ;}, and the result is
 * {@code spec*count}. Specs are {@code log:<species>}, {@code planks:<species>}, {@code beam:<species>},
 * {@code rod:<material>} ({@code OP.stick}), {@code rodlong:<material>} ({@code OP.stickLong}) and
 * {@code tool:<id>} (a {@code GTToolType} id). {@code Loader_WoodCraftingRecipes} resolves them and
