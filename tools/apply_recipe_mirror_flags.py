"""Give every ``gregtech:tool_shaped`` recipe the mirror rule its GT6 row actually uses.

GT6 sets ``MIR`` per row (``gregapi/util/CR.java:131-163``: ``DEF = BUF|NO_REM``, ``DEF_MIR =
DEF|MIR``), and 93 of its 1188 ``CR.shaped`` rows opt in — the rest do not mirror. 1.20.1 mirrors
shaped recipes by default, so the port has to state the original's answer explicitly, otherwise two
rows that differ only by a mirrored tool symbol (the logistics export/storage buses) collapse into
one craftable recipe.

Provenance: ``docs/gt6-crafting-mirror-flags.json`` (``tools/census_gt6_recipe_mirror_flags.py``)
maps a pattern signature to "some GT6 row with this pattern allows mirroring". A recipe whose pattern
appears in that set keeps mirroring; every other one is written with ``allow_mirror: false``. Recipes
that state the flag by hand (the §16/§17 batches) are left alone; recipes this tool wrote carry
``"_mirror_flags": "gt6-census"`` so a later census can re-decide them.

Usage:  python tools/apply_recipe_mirror_flags.py [--check]
