"""Cross-check which materials of the generated enchantment table exist in the port.

The table's rows are the receiver of GT6's `addEnchantmentFor…` calls, i.e. GT6 **field** names
(`Ma`, `Fe`, `PO4`, `Polycarbonate`), not material names. They are resolved through the generated
field table (`GTMaterialFields`) and then matched against the port's own material registry names,
which the language file stores without spaces (`Hard Plastic` -> `material.gregtech.hardplastic`).

Rows that name a material this port does not have are other mods' materials GT6 enchanted for
compatibility; they are listed separately so a real regression (a port material losing its row)
stands out.
