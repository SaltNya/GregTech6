"""Fix the DidYouKnow hint rows: use only specs the port resolves.

The first version named the GT6 machines through `tech:<id>` specs, but the port registers those
blocks with ids of its own (several with per-tier names), so all five rows were skipped. The rows now
show the materials/items/fluids the port definitely has and name the machines in the GT6 labels.
