"""Generate the missing GT6-species tree assets and fix the property-variant blockstates of the
GT6 wood blocks.

Two jobs:

1. ``sapling_<species>`` for the four GT6 tree species that only existed as decorative icon-set
   blocks (hazel, cinnamon, coconut, blue spruce): blockstate, block model (cross) and item model,
   all reusing the ``sapling_small_<species>`` texture GT6 ships.
2. Re-emit the blockstates of the GT6 wood blocks with the property variants their block classes
   actually declare — ``LeavesBlock`` has ``distance``/``persistent`` and ``SaplingBlock`` has
   ``stage``, so the single ``""`` variant the icon-set generator produced never matched a real
   block state (missing model). ``log_*``/``beam_*`` (axis) and ``planks_*`` were already correct.
