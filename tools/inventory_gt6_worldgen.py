"""Inventory GT6's worldgen objects vs the port's ports of them.

Lists every `Worldgen*` class under GT6's worldgen packages, whether it appears in
Loader_Worldgen's registration block, and what the port does about it.

The port rarely keeps GT6's class names (it has one `GTRocksFeature` for `WorldgenRocks`, one
`GTTreesFeature` for the nine `WorldgenTree*` genera, …) and GT6 ships several generators for other
mods' dimensions, so the answer comes from `PORTED`/`SKIPPED` below first and only falls back to
grepping the port for the class name. Anything that is neither mapped nor mentioned is genuinely
missing.
