"""Write the vanilla block tags for the port's GT6 wood so vanilla mechanics (and other mods) see
them: ``minecraft:logs`` (leaf distance propagation, axe stripping, "is this a log" checks) and
``minecraft:leaves``.

Without these tags vanilla's LeavesBlock never finds a log near a GT6 leaf, so its distance stays at
7 and the leaf decays — the bug that made naturally grown GT6 trees lose their leaves.
